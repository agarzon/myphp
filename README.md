# MyPHP (deprecated)

**webdevops now includes ioncube, so no need to use this images anymore**



Docker image based on **webdevops/php-nginx-dev** but adding a little more :-)

It runs *PHP 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4* as FPM with NGINX.

## What do I added?:
* Ioncube loader
* phpunit

## Want to give a try?
